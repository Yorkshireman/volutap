## FAQs

### How private is my data?

Most interactions in the app are tracked for analytics, purely to get insights into how often users use certain features, so the app can be further improved. However, no personal data is collected and no sensitive data is collected such as the names of your counts that you save, so you can rest assured you can call your counts whatever you like and no one will ever know!
