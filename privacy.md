# Privacy Policy — VoluTap

Last updated: 2026-01-27

This privacy notice explains what information the VoluTap app (the "App") collects, how we use it, and the choices you have. VoluTap is a simple counting app that can be used with on-screen controls or your phone's volume buttons. The App uses Amplitude for analytics. We do not collect or transmit the names you give your saved counts.

## Summary (plain English)

- The App collects anonymous usage data (events like "count incremented", which button was used, screen views, crashes) to help improve the product.
- The App does not collect personal names, email addresses, or other personally-identifying information (PII) about users by default. In particular, the titles you give saved counts are not sent to our analytics system.
- Analytics are provided by Amplitude (a third-party service). See the "Third parties" section for details.
- If you want your analytics data removed, contact us (see "Contact & data requests").

## What we collect

### Events & analytics (Amplitude)

- Anonymous events such as:
- count_changed (includes old/new value, direction, and which control triggered the change: screen button or volume button)
- count_saved
- screen_view (which app screen the user saw)
- Event properties are limited to non-identifying fields (e.g. numeric values, booleans, internal IDs). The app does not send saved count titles/names to Amplitude.

### Identifiers & network-level info

- Amplitude (and other analytics providers) may receive an anonymous device identifier and the device IP address (used by providers to resolve general geolocation). We do not use these to identify you by name.
- We may generate and persist an anonymous identifier on the device to help us understand returning users. This identifier is stored locally on the device.

### What we do not collect

- You will not be asked for or tracked by personal name, email, phone number or other PII by default.
- Saved-count titles (the names you type for counts) are stored locally in the device's memory and are not sent to analytics.

## How we use the data

- Improve app stability and performance.
- Understand which features are used so we can prioritise improvements (e.g. how often the volume-button counting mode is used).
- Diagnose errors and crashes.
- Produce aggregated, anonymised reports to guide product decisions.

We do not sell your data to third parties.

## Third parties

- Amplitude — we send anonymous analytics events to Amplitude for event tracking and analytics. Amplitude may process IP addresses and device identifiers on their systems. You can read Amplitude's privacy documentation for more detail.

## Data retention & deletion

- Analytics events are stored and processed by Amplitude. If you want events associated with your device removed, contact us (see below) with details of the anonymous identifier or a clear description of your device and request deletion. We will work with Amplitude to remove your data.
- Locally stored saved counts and settings remain on your device unless you delete the app or clear the app data.

## Your choices

- Opt out of analytics: If the App exposes an "Analytics" toggle in Settings you can turn it off. If no toggle exists you can:
- disable network access for the app,
- or uninstall the app to stop further collection.
- Delete local data: Delete the app to remove locally stored counts or use any "Clear data" option inside the app if provided.
- Data deletion requests: Contact us with a data removal request and we will handle reasonable requests to delete analytics data associated with your device.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the data we control. Analytics and crash data are transmitted over HTTPS. However, no system is completely secure — if you have concerns about storing specific sensitive information in the app, avoid entering it.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Substantive changes will be posted here with an updated "Last updated" date.

## Contact & data requests

- request deletion of analytics data,
- ask what data we hold about you,
